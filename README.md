This is my first Python project that I uploaded to Github.
It is an incredibly simple text game where you can guess a number that is randomly generated.
I know it isn't much, but I will update it regularly for a while until I am satisfied with it.
I will probably add a snake game, flappy bird, and hopefully I can make a multiplayer game that you can play with a friend.
